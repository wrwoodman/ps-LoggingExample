# PostSharp Logging Example using Nlog.
This is a sample project used to demonstrate how to inject properties into PostSharp logging using NLog. In this example, a property, called the UniqueId, is injected into the PostSharp activity cycle.  This allows the UID to be injected into all the log files without having to do any additional work.

This is a working example that uses PostSharp developer mode, an NLog custom renderer, and provides a sample UI using Swagger.  This is written in .NET Core 3.1.
